# Lectures Housing - QR Code Attendance System

## Overview
The **Lectures Housing** project is designed to provide a convenient and efficient solution for professors at universities to take attendance for students using QR code technology. This system aims to streamline the attendance process, enhance classroom management, and allow professors to focus more on delivering quality education.

## Goal
Our goal is to develop a user-friendly application that enables professors to effortlessly record attendance by scanning QR codes associated with each student. By doing so, we aim to:
- Reduce the time and effort required for attendance management.
- Improve accuracy in attendance tracking.
- Provide valuable data insights to enhance student learning outcomes.
- Enhance the overall educational experience for both professors and students.

## Features
